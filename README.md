## Lyrics

```
flies buzzing mixed with human chatter

all that we behest
falling mind into dirt
real often 
sitting juice sipping
energy lashing

lord of flies
lord of flies

drowned in isolation
turned your eyes white 
so decide if it's time
survival above all

forgivin' audacity
made me feel all null
got charged with 
assualt on myself
through giving away my controls

buzzkill
```
